# GMTK-2025

### bug list:
unfair first shuffle, make sure first shuffle does not go to dead end

### ideas:
combos:
	higher scores if combo detected when discarding:
		- straight numbers: (2,3,4), (3,4,5), ..., (8,9,10), no need to be in order just straight on board
		- KQJ
show cards that has been discarded? easier track what combos can still be done
are players supposed to be able to swap with top of trash?
