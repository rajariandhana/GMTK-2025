# QQ Joker
Loop your way to achieve higher score and leave with $$$.

### How to play (written here since we don't have time to write it in game):
You are given 3 cards on board and 4 on your hand. You can swap cards between board and hand. When all 3 cards on board matches their suit, they are discarded. Each level spawns new cards until all four suit appears, boss cards, face cards, even joker.

### Combos
You can achieve a higher score by matching certain cards
- no combo: just same suit +30
- $TRAIGHT: straight numbers +60
- ROYAL$: King, Queen, Jack +100
*they don't have to be in order, board just consists a combination of them.

### Jokers
Joker is a wild card. You can use it to pair with anything.
